# Recon Report — LOD Architecture

The recon report uses the same Level of Detail architecture as findings. Instead of a single monolithic file, recon data is written as atomic section files consumed selectively by downstream agents.

## File Structure

```

## LOD-0: Summary Table (in index.md)

Each recon agent returns one LOD-0 row. The orchestrator assembles these into the index. The Step column links to the full LOD-2 step file.

Format: `| [Step #](recon/step-{NN}-{name}.md) | [Section Name] | [Key facts — one line] |`

Example:
```
| # | Section | Key Facts |
|---|---------|-----------|
| [1](recon/step-01-metadata.md) | Project Metadata | TypeScript, Firebase Cloud Functions, Node 22, Jest |
| [3](recon/step-03-http.md) | HTTP Entry Points | 12 endpoints: 4 unauth, 8 auth, 5 background |
| [5](recon/step-05-crown-jewels.md) | Crown Jewels | OAuth tokens (KMS encrypted), PII (email/name), automated email sending |
| [6](recon/step-06-auth.md) | Auth & AuthZ | Firebase Auth, Firestore rules, Cloud KMS token encryption |
```

---

## LOD-1: Section Brief (in index.md)

Each recon agent returns one LOD-1 paragraph. The orchestrator assembles these below the LOD-0 table. The "Details" field MUST be a markdown link to the step file.

Format:
```
### Step N: [Section Name]
**[Key metric]:** [value]
**Key files:** [2-4 most important file paths with line numbers]
**Notable:** [1-2 sentences on security-relevant observations — facts only, not analysis]
**Details:** [recon/step-{NN}-{name}.md](recon/step-{NN}-{name}.md)
```

Example:
```
### Step 3: HTTP Entry Points
**Endpoints:** 12 (4 unauthenticated, 8 authenticated, 5 background/scheduled)
**Key files:** functions/src/index.ts:1-50, functions/src/webhooks.ts:1-30
**Notable:** 2 unauthenticated webhook endpoints accept external input. processUserEmails is a Cloud Task handler.
**Details:** [recon/step-03-http.md](recon/step-03-http.md)
```

---

## LOD-2: Atomic Section Files

Each recon agent writes its full section to `{RECON_DIR}/step-{NN}-{name}.md`. These contain the complete tables with every file:line reference. The format for each step follows.

Every table row MUST include **absolute file paths with line numbers** (e.g., `/path/to/file.ts:42`) so downstream agents can `Read` directly.

| Document | Path | Relevance |

---

### step-03-http.md — HTTP Entry Points

#### Unauthenticated Endpoints

| Endpoint | File:Line | Method | Purpose | Auth Required | Input Sources |
|----------|-----------|--------|---------|---------------|---------------|

#### Authenticated Endpoints

| Endpoint | File:Line | Method | Purpose | Auth Mechanism | Input Sources |
|----------|-----------|--------|---------|----------------|---------------|

#### Background/Scheduled Functions

| Function | File:Line | Trigger | Schedule/Event | Auth Mechanism |
|----------|-----------|---------|----------------|----------------|

Include: HTTP handlers, webhooks, API routes, RPC endpoints, scheduled jobs, event-driven functions, message queue consumers.

---

### step-04-boundaries.md — Trust Boundaries

#### Documented Trust Model

If the project contains a SECURITY.md, security policy, or threat model document, extract and present the declared trust model here. If no documented trust model exists, write "No documented trust model found."

| Element | Source Document | Details |
|---------|----------------|---------|
| Trust Level | | e.g., "Internal services: trusted", "Webhooks: untrusted" |
| Accepted Risk | | Documented risk acceptances with rationale |
| Threat Assumption | | Declared attacker model, in-scope/out-of-scope |
| Security Invariant | | Assumptions the system explicitly relies on |

#### External Audit Findings (OpenClaw / Other Tools)

If openclaw results or other external audit tool outputs are found, summarize confirmed findings here. If none found, write "No external audit results detected."

| Audit Tool | Finding ID | Severity | Affected File | Status | Summary |
|------------|-----------|----------|---------------|--------|---------|

**Audit summary:** [total findings, severity breakdown, confirmed vs. unconfirmed]

#### Code-Inferred Trust Boundaries

| Boundary | Direction | Source | Destination | Data Exchanged | Protection | Trust Model Status |
|----------|-----------|--------|-------------|----------------|------------|--------------------|

The "Trust Model Status" column indicates alignment with the documented trust model:
- `[DOCUMENTED]` — boundary matches a declared trust level or assumption
- `[MISMATCH]` — boundary contradicts the documented model (investigate further)
- `[UNDOCUMENTED]` — no corresponding entry in the documented trust model

Categories to identify:
- **External → System**: Webhooks, callbacks, API endpoints receiving external input
- **User → System**: Authenticated user actions, client-side writes
- **System → External**: Outbound API calls, email sending, third-party integrations
- **Client → Database**: Direct database reads/writes from client code

| Malicious Input Source | None | Controls content processed by the system | | |
| Compromised Integration | API-level | Can send forged responses/callbacks | | |
| Insider/Admin | Elevated | Direct infrastructure access | | |

Add project-specific profiles as discovered.

### step-09-data-flows.md — Data Flows

Identify the critical data flows through the system. For each, trace the path from source to destination.

#### Flow: [Name]

| Step | File:Line | Input | Transformation | Output | Sanitization |
|------|-----------|-------|----------------|--------|-------------|

Repeat for each critical flow (typically 3-6 flows covering: user input processing, credential lifecycle, external trigger handling, automated actions).

**Note:** This step runs in Wave B — it has access to Wave A LOD-0 summaries for entry points, auth mechanisms, and integrations. Read the relevant step files from `{RECON_DIR}/` for full detail.
