## Agent Design

All agents are `generalPurpose` subagents (need Bash, Read, Grep, Glob for code analysis and git history mining). Each agent:

1. Reads the recon index for LOD-0+1 overview, selectively reads LOD-2 step files for relevant sections
2. Reads prior stage findings (if applicable)
3. Performs its specialized analysis
4. Reports findings using the standard finding template
5. Reports incidental findings (IX-prefixed) for issues outside its focus area

### Key Principles

- **Offensive framing**: Every analysis starts with "If I were attacking this system..."
- **Concrete exploits**: Every Medium+ finding includes reproducible attack steps and PoC
- **Chain analysis**: Low findings that enable Medium findings that enable Critical exploits = Critical chain
- **Git history mining**: Past fixes often have incomplete variants
- **OWASP LLM Top 10**: Dedicated agent covers all 10 categories plus a mitigation verification pass
- **Framework plugins**: After recon, framework-specific plugins are auto-detected and injected into relevant agent prompts. 16 plugins available
- **Dynamic scoping**: Recon determines which agents to skip (no frontend agent for backend-only projects, no LLM agent for projects without AI)
- **Stage discipline**: Later stages depend on earlier findings; never start a stage early
- **Critic validation**: Adversarial review catches false positives before the final report

## Level of Detail (LOD) Architecture

Agent reports use a three-tier Level of Detail system to minimize context consumption across independent agent context windows:

| Level | Content | ~Tokens | Where it lives |
|---|---|---|---|
| LOD-0 | `ID \| Severity \| One sentence` | 30/finding | Agent return message, orchestrator context, `{PRIOR_FINDINGS_SUMMARY}` |
| LOD-1 | ID + title + severity + CVSS + CWE + file:line + paragraph | 100/finding | `{FINDINGS_DIR}/index.md`, terminal agent prompts |
| LOD-2 | Full finding with PoC, remediation, regression test | 800/finding | `{FINDINGS_DIR}/{FINDING-ID}.md`, read on demand |

**How it flows:**
1. Analysis agents write atomic LOD-2 files to `{FINDINGS_DIR}/` and return LOD-0 summaries
2. The orchestrator builds `{FINDINGS_DIR}/index.md` with LOD-0 + LOD-1 views
3. Next-stage agents receive LOD-0 in their prompt; selectively `Read` LOD-2 files for relevant findings
4. Terminal agents (exploit dev, critic, report writer) receive LOD-1 index; `Read` all LOD-2 files

This saves 80-96% of prompt tokens for downstream agents while preserving full detail on disk.

### Recon LOD Architecture

The recon report uses the same LOD architecture as findings:

| Level | Content | Where it lives |
|---|---|---|
| LOD-0 | `Step # \| Section Name \| Key facts` | `{RECON_DIR}/index.md` (top table) |
| LOD-1 | Key metric + key files + notable observations + details link | `{RECON_DIR}/index.md` (section briefs) |
| LOD-2 | Full tables with every file:line reference | `{RECON_DIR}/step-{NN}-{name}.md` |

**How it flows:**
1. 14 parallel recon agents each write one LOD-2 step file and return LOD-0+1 summaries
2. The orchestrator assembles `recon/index.md` with LOD-0 table + LOD-1 briefs
3. Downstream agents read the index, then selectively read relevant step files
4. Each downstream agent's prompt specifies which step files are most relevant

### Task-Driven Progress Tracking

All stages use TaskCreate for user-visible progress. Every agent gets a task with naming convention `"Stage N: <description>"`. Agents claim tasks from TaskList, execute per the task description, and mark tasks completed. Users see real-time progress via the task checklist.

## Context Budget Considerations

The LOD architecture mitigates most context pressure, but be aware:
- The LLM agent prompt (`attack-surface-llm.md`) is ~340 lines before plugin injection — the largest single prompt
- Terminal agents (exploit dev, critic, report writer) still read all LOD-2 files via tool calls; for runs with 40+ findings, consider batching reads
- Plugin sections add to every injected agent's context — keep plugins concise

## Adding New Agents

1. Create a prompt file in `references/prompts/` following the pattern of existing prompts
2. Use placeholders: `{RECON_INDEX_PATH}`, `{RECON_DIR}`, `{FINDING_TEMPLATE_PATH}`, `{PRIOR_FINDINGS_SUMMARY}`
3. Define a finding ID prefix (e.g., `NEW-XXX`)
4. Add the agent to the appropriate stage in `references/commands/security-analyst.md`

## Adding New Plugins

1. Create a `.md` file in `references/plugins/` (e.g., `spring-boot.md`)
2. Add YAML frontmatter with `name` and `detect` criteria (files, dependencies, keywords)
3. Add `## {agent-name}` sections with framework-specific security checks
4. The orchestrator auto-detects plugins after recon and injects matching sections into agent prompts
5. See `references/plugins/README.md` for the full format spec
